Deep Learning has emerged as a new area in machine learning and is applied to a number of signal and image applications. The main purpose of the work presented in this paper, is to apply the concept of a Deep Learning algorithm namely, Convolutional neural networks (CNN) in image classification for application in Industries. This paper presents an approach for real-time training and testing for image classification for the real-time detection and recognition of targets in Industrial Setup to monitor Employees. In this paper, we propose to use deep learning algorithms to achieve the expected results in industries for monitoring Attendance. Starting with use the Digit of MNIST data set as a bench mark for classification of grayscale images in general. Moreover, the proposed method can be used to detect and recognise targets in street
